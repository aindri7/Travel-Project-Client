            <h1>Somnath Temple</h1>
            <img src="images/jyot1.jpg" alt="Description of image" class="content-image">
            <p>Shree Somnath is first among the twelve Aadi Jyotirlings of India. It has a strategic location on the western coast of India.
            <br>
            Ancient Indian traditions maintain a close relationship of Somnath with release of Chandra (Moon God) from the curse of his father-in-law Daksha Prajapati. Moon was married to Twenty-Seven daughters of Daksha. However, he favoured Rohini and neglected other queens. The aggrieved Daksha cursed Moon and the Moon lost power of light. With the advice of Prajapita Brahma, Moon arrived at the Prabhas Teerth and worshipped Bhagvan Shiva. Pleased with the great penance and devotion of Moon, Bhagvan Shiva blessed him and relieved him from the curse of darkness. Pauranic traditions maintain that Moon had built a golden temple, followed by a silver temple by Ravana, Bhagvan Shree Krishna is believed to have built Somnath temple with Sandalwood.
            <br> 
            The research based on ancient Indian classical texts show that first Somnath Jyotirling Pran-Pratistha was done on the auspicious third day of brighter half of Shravan month during the tenth Treta yug of Vaivswat Manvantar. Swami Shri Gajananand Saraswatiji, Chairman of Shrimad Aadhya Jagadguru Shankaracharya Vedic Shodh Sansthan, Varanasi suggested that the said first temple was built 7,99,25,105 years ago as derived from the traditions of Prabhas Khand of Skand Puran. Thus, this temple is a perennial source of inspiration for millions of Hindus since time immemorial.
            <br> 
            The Moon God is said to have been relieved from the curse of his father-in-law Daksha Prajapati by the blessings of Bhagvan Somnath. In the Shiva Purana and Nandi Upapurana, Shiva said, `I am always present everywhere but specially in 12 forms and places as the Jyotirlingas`. Somnath is one of these 12 holy places. This is the first among the twelve holy Shiva Jyotirlings.
            <br>
            The later sources of history account for several desecrations by Muslims invaders during eleventh to eighteen century A.D. The temple was rebuilt every time with the reconstructive spirit of the people. The modern temple was reconstructed with the resolve of Sardar Patel who visited the ruins of Somnath temple on November 13 1947. Then President of India, Late Dr.Rajendra Prasad, performed the Pran-Pratistha at the existing temple on 11 May 1951.
            <br>  
            Other spots in the temple are Shri Kapardi Vinayak and Shri Hanuman Temple in addition to Vallabhghat. Vallabhghat is a beautiful sunset point. The temple is illuminated every evening. Similarly, the Sound & Light Show “Jay Somnath” is also displayed every night at 7.45 to 8.45, which allows the pilgrims an ethereal experience in the backdrop of grand Somnath temple and the holy wave sounds of the Ocean.</p>

        <h1>Mallikarjuna Temple</h1>
        <img src="images/Mallikarjuna.png" alt="Description of image" class="content-image">
        <p>When Goddess Parvati asked Lord Shiva about his most desired place apart from Kailasa in the Universe created by him, he chose the eternally beautiful place nestled among picturesque nature, the avatar of Sri Chakra, the holy Srisailam. In such a significant location, Shiva-Shakti take the form of Sri Mallikarjuna Bhramaramba to bless all their devotees.
        <br>
        As proven in Puranas, Srisailam has great ancient significance. Among the 12 Jyotirlingas, the 2nd is the Mallikarjuna Swamy Lingam; among the 18 Maha Shakti Peethas, the 6th is Sri Bhramaramba Devi temple. Srisailam is the only temple where two such icons exist under one temple premise, such is its significance. Srisailam has many other names like Srigiri, Sirigiri, Sriparvatam and Srinagam. Narasimhaswamy in Satyayugam, Sri Rama alongside Sita Devi in Tretayugam, all five Pandavas in Dvaparayugam, many Yogis, Rishis, Munis, preachers, spiritual teachers, Kings, poets and devotees in Kalyug have visited Srisailam and earned the blessings of Sri Bhramarambika Devi and Mallikarjuna Swamy.

        <div class="mahakaleshwar" id="jyotirlingas">
            <h1>Mahakaleshwar Temple</h1>
        <img src="images/Mahakaleshwar-Shiva-Temples.jpg" alt="Description of image" class="content-image">
        <p>When did the Mahakala temple first come in existence, is difficult to tell. However, the event may be assigned to the Pre-historic period. Puranas narrate that it was first established by Prajapita Brahma. There is reference to the appointment of prince Kumarasena by king Chanda Pradyota in 6th c. BC for looking after the law and order situations of Mahakala temple. The punch-marked coins of Ujjain, belonging to 4th-3rd c. BC, bear the figure of Lord Siva on them.
        <br>
        Mahakala temple is also mentioned in several ancient Indian poetic texts. According to these texts, the temple had been very magnificent and magnanimous.Its foundation and platform were built of stones. The temple rested on the wooden pillars.There had been no sikharas on the temples prior to the Gupta period. The roofs of temples had mostly been flat.Possibly due to this fact, Kalidasa in Raghuvansam described this temple as 'Niketana'.The palace of the king had been in the vicinity of the temple. In the early part of the Meghadutam (Purva Megha),Kalidasa gives a fascinating description of the Mahakala temple.
        <br>
        It appears that this Chandisvara temple might have been a unique example of the then art and architecture. It may be ascertained that how splendid had been the temple of the main Deity of that town which possessedmulti-storeyed gold-plated palaces and buildings and the superb artistic grandeur. The temple was enclosed by high ramparts attached with the entry-gates.At twilight the lively rows of glittering lamps enlightened the temple-complex.</p>

        <div class="kedarnath" id="jyotirlingas">
            <h1>Kedarnath Temple</h1>
            <img src="images/kedarnath.jpg" alt="Description of image" class="content-image">
            <p>The legend behind this famous place of worship is that after the Mahabharata war, the Pandavas performed a penance to purge their sins - of killing their kin. In order to be able to do this, they were advised to seek Lord Shiva's pardon. They searched high and low and finally, saw Lord Shiva at the spot where the jyotirlinga in Kedarnath is situated today.
            <br>
            It is said that Lord Shiva was not willing to forgive the Pandavas for their deceit and sins during the war and hence hid himself from them. He disguised himself as a bull and disappeared into the ground.
            <br>    
            The second Pandava, Bhimasena, tried to pull him out of the ground by tugging at his tail and hind legs. However, Lord Shiva dug himself deeper and only reappeared in parts in different places - the hump in Kedarnath, the arms in Tunganath, the navel and stomach in Madhyamaheshwar, the face in Rudranath, and the hair and head in Kalpeshwar.
            <br>    
            The Pandavas built temples at these five places - the Panch Kedars - for worshipping Shiva. This freed them from their sins.
            <br>
            Lord Shiva further promised to stay on in the sacred spot as a triangular jyotirlinga. This is why Kedarnath is so famous and revered by devotees.</p>

            <h1>Bhimashankar Temple</h1>
            <img src="images/bhimashankar.jpeg" alt="Description of image" class="content-image">
            <p>There are different legends associated with the Bhimashankar Jyotirlinga. Here are two of them.
            <br>
            According to one legend, a demon called Tripurasura performed penance in the Bhimashankar jungle to please Lord Shiva and ask him for the gift of immortality. Lord Shiva was pleased with his devotion and granted him immortality on the condition that he would use his power to help the local people. Tripurasura agreed with Him. However, over time, he forgot his promise and began to harass both humans and the gods. When the gods begged Lord Shiva to do something to stop the ensuing chaos, the Lord prayed to his consort Goddess Parvati. Both of them appeared as Ardhanari Nateshwara and killed Tripurasura, after which peace prevailed.
            <br>  
            According to another legend, in the Dakini forests on the ranges of the Sahyadri Mountains lived an asura (demon) named Bhima with his mother Karkati. He was, in fact, the son of Kumbharkarna, the younger brother of King Ravana. When he learnt that Lord Vishnu had killed his father in his avatar as Rama, he was furious. He vowed revenge and performed severe penance to please Lord Brahma.
            <br>    
            In return, Brahma blessed him with immense strength, which he used to terrorize the world. He imprisoned an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva, Kamrupeshwar and demanded that he pray to him instead of Lord Shiva. When Kamrupeshwar refused to do so, Bhima raised his sword to destroy the Shivalinga. That is when Lord Shiva appeared before him and reduced him to ashes. The place where Lord Shiva manifested himself is the spot the Shivalinga is believed to be now.</p>
